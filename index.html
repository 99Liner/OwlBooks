        Welcome to the OwlBooks Accounting Web Application
    </h1>

    <p>
        We will develop a comprehensive accounting web application accessible to administrators, managers, and basic users. This platform empowers users to effortlessly create charts of accounts, input date-stamped transactions with source documents, post transactions to designated accounts, generate trial balances, perform ratio analyses, and produce income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements. Our web application will be compatible with all major web browsers and can be accessed seamlessly from both desktop and mobile devices.
